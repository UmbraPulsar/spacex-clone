## Why I wanted to make this.
> I wanted to make this to practice my css transitions. While I wanted it to be completely "vanilla" by building it completely out of css modules and personally crafted components. I did have to use 2 because it's difficult to build a trigger scrolled counter. react-visiblity-sensor and CounterUp. Both were used to create animated stat boxes which are trigged when they enter the viewport. 

This project was made with Next js.
